# Food Safety in Wales 

Project outline


The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is a non-ministerial government body that is responsible for food safety and hygiene in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The FSA gathers information on public food practices by conducting surveys. The Food and You Survey (F&Y) is a flagship biennial study that explores the public's attitudes, knowledge and behaviour relating to food safety and production. Data is analysed and used to compile publicly available reports. \\

Wales is demographically distinct to the rest of the UK, being less populous, more deprived, with a larger rural population. For this reason, the FSA was particularly concerned that its F&Y engagement activities do not reach some of the demographic groups in Wales, who may have associated food risks. The following specific questions were posed: \\

* Does F&Y survey sampling reflect the true demographic profile of Wales? \
* What food risks are associated with undersampled groups, and what is their understanding of food labelling? \
* Are there any relationships between behaviours related to food safety, and can we predict food risk for specific groups or individuals?
